Build the project-planner app following the specifications in docs/. Read PRODUCT_SPEC.md for features, TECH_STACK.md for technology choices, DATABASE_SCHEMA.md for data models, DESIGN_SYSTEM.md for UI guidelines, PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md for code organization, API_STRUCTURE.md for API endpoints, AUTH_FLOWS.md for authentication implementation, and ROADMAP.md for iteration order. Follow the roadmap iterations in sequence: Iteration 0 (Foundations), then Iteration 1 (Core MVP), then Iteration 2 (Workflow Polish), then Iteration 3 (Release Hardening). Meet exit criteria for each iteration before moving to the next. Commit after each working feature. Output <promise>APP COMPLETE</promise> when all iterations are complete and exit criteria are met.
